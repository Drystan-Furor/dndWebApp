        To facilitate homebrew you have the option to enter your custom race name, or choose to enter a race name from the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/races">DnD Beyond races</a>. <br>
        If nothing is entered the generator randomly chooses
        one of the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/races">DnD Beyond races</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is a work in progress, for now it generates :
    <ul>
        <li>a random race <ul>
                <li>sometimes with a little background information.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>NPC's get a name according to race lore, adhering to <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/">WotC's idea's</a> where possible,
            <ul>
                <li>otherwise it generates a random name by lore naming conventions shared by Forgotten Realms.
            </ul>
        </li>
        </li>
        <li>Any and all races are optimalized for their ages, in a range between the stages of a child and whatever is a race specific maximum age.</li>

                <li>teeth</li>
            </ul>
        <li>There is a randomly chosen mood</li>
        <li>If there are noticble scars or wounds visible.</li>
        <li>The amount of wealth is determined and based off that a fitting wardrobe is applied </li>

        <li>and each one carries a random weapon.</li>
