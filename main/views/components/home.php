                    If you ever played D&D you might have experience with social encounters.<br>
                    Being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Master">Dungeon Master (DM)</a> is a challenge.<br></p>
                <p>    
                    We have to prepare a game session, but we cannot prepare everything so sometimes we improvise. <br>
                    However, with great improvisation comes great responsibility: <b>details.</b></p>
                <p>
                    We make lists and use dice to randomly decide what <em>details</em> we will use.<br>
                    I remeber writing one page after another with random unimportant details that do not impact the story of a DM, like a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/d100/comments/l2oo00/d100_familiar_behavior/">D100 List: Familiar Behavior</a><br>
                    This led me to <a href="https://www.dndspeak.com/">a marvellous website with more D100 lists</a>.</p>
                <p>
                    Now we developed an app to make more "D100" lists beyond the scope of 100, and we no longer need books, notes, notepads, lists or dices to
                    prepare details.
                    Imagine, with one click of the mouse, a script rolls all dices and combine all results into a small text block, reading it out loud gives a detailed, unique yet fully randomized NPC. Next time my party walks into a tavern
                    and ask the DM what people are inside, we have a support-tool to come up with memorable or less memorable characters. Click the button and see who they meet!</p>
