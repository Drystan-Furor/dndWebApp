We make a new_npc
it gets all the classes as properties
the "sub" classes will genreate their own properties
new_npc therefore will be an Object made of Classes
accesing the subclass getters will return the value of the property
we use these to make a sentence.

class DndRngNpc
{
    get face -> get eyes;
                get nose;
                get mouth;

                get chin;
